# iMX8 containers

iMX8 containers contain platform-specific packages from the Toradex feed at https://feeds.toradex.com/debian/.

## gputop

While we do provide a gputop container, it's useless to run it outside the process namepace where the graphical applications are running. Essentialy, you need to run `gputop` inside the same container as the graphical applications are running, otherwise you won't see anything.

As an example, if you're running a Qt5 application and you want to monitor it with gputop, run the application as usual adding the `--privileged` flag (`gputop` uses debugfs under the hood):

```
docker run -it --rm --name=qt5-wayland-examples -v /dev/dri:/dev/dri -v /dev/galcore:/dev/galcore -v /tmp:/tmp --device-cgroup-rule='c 199:* rmw' --privileged torizon/qt5-wayland-examples-imx8:rc /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/qt5/examples/opengl/cube/cube
```

For a graphical application you should have mounted the GPU-related device descriptors already, but `--privileged` will auto-mount them anyway, as well as have the effect of `--device-cgroup-rule='c *:* rmw'`.

Then exec into the running container, update, install and run gputop (note the `cube` application):

```

## weston

Weston should run before any other application, because it also instanciates the Wayland Server. In some cases, graphical applications that require the Wayland socket may start faster than Weston. To prevent this, we implement a container HEALTHCHECK so containers that depend on Weston can wait until the Wayland server is fully up.

To use it, add the following as a dependency in `docker-compose.yml`

```
depends_on:
  weston:
    condition: service_healthy
```

If you have a third service that depends on Weston and some other service, specify a condition for that other service as well, for example

```
depends_on:
  portainer:
    condition: service_started
  weston:
    condition: service_healthy
```
